# DiscogsAppV2
symfony app using Discogs API and JolitaGrazite package to browse my Discogs seller profile and have my own stats or ranks

new version of myDiscogsSellerInventory, which was entirely built on vanilla php

still based on CSV files from my Discogs seller profile

using Symfony php framework allowed me to focus on some particular requests in my DB, and add some features

Bootstrap css framework helped me to stay close to the GUI I liked in the old version
