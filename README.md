# DiscogsAppV2
symfony app to browse my Discogs collection, and seller inventory

now towards V3 :

https://github.com/JolitaGrazyte/discogs-api made it easier for me to reach Discogs API breakpoints

currently browsing through my Inventory, Orders, Collection... in order to implement these into the GUI

next step : Symfony authentication + Discogs API => allow any seller to browse his own stats and ranks
