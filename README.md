# DiscogsAppV2

new version of myDiscogsSellerInventory, which was entirely built on vanilla php

using Symfony php framework allowed me to focus on some particular requests in my DB, and add some features

Bootstrap css framework helped me to stay close to the GUI I liked in the old version

now towards V3 :

discogs-api package by JolitaGrazyte made it easier for me to reach Discogs API breakpoints

next step : Symfony authentication + Discogs API => allow any seller to browse his own stats and ranks
